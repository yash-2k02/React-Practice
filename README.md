# Redux Practice in JS

This project demonstrates core Redux concepts through practical examples â€” starting with basic `actions`, `reducers`, and `store`, then expanding to middleware patterns like **redux-logger**, **redux-thunk**, and **redux-saga** for handling async API calls.

---

### Core Redux Concepts

- Creating **actions** and **action creators**
- Writing **pure reducers** for updating state
- Creating and using the **Redux store**
- **Subscribing** to store changes

### Combine Reducers

- Combined multiple reducers using `combineReducers`
- Dispatched actions independently to each reducer

### Redux Logger

- Installed and applied **redux-logger** middleware
- Observed dispatched actions and resulting state transitions
