# React + MUI Form Practice

This is a simple form built using **React** and **Material UI (MUI)** that demonstrates the use of:

- React state management with `useState`
- MUI's `TextField`, `Button`, and `Typography`
- MUI Date Picker with `LocalizationProvider` and `AdapterDateFns`
- Controlled form submission and date formatting

---

## Features

- Input a **title** using a `TextField`
- Select a **date** using MUI's `DatePicker`
- On submission, the form:
  - Retrieves the title and date
  - Formats the date into a JavaScript `Date` object
  - Logs the `cardInfo` object containing the title and date to the console
